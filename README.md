------------------------------------------- PYTHON SUDUKO GAME/SOLVER --------------------------------------------------

 This repository was created to in an attempt to further my programming knowledge and become more adept in Python.
 Anyone is welcome to change the code and I would gladly welcome discussions and or suggestions bout any apect of the
 code...

 The Sudoku_Solver_2.0.py solves simple suduko problems, harder puzzles have not been trialed yet. The starting puzzle is
 represented by a 2D matrix with missing numbers represented as 0's. All integers from 1 to 9 are stacked behind this 2D
 matrix to produce a 3D matrix 10 elements deep. Then three functions in the script replace these stacked ints with 0 if
 they are not possible due to suduko rules for example the first function removes any values that already exist in the
 row.

 Eventually, I hope to produce a GUI front from the Sudoku.py for solver the that uses user inputs rather then the suduko
 needing to be hard coded in the Sudoku_Solver_2.0.py.

 The Sudoku.py is in a very alpha stage due to my lack of knowledge with the pygame module.
